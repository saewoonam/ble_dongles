 - This code uses the included modified version of the code here: https://github.com/sparkfun/RFM69HCW_Breakout/tree/master/Libraries/Arduino/RFM69
 - Modifications:
   - readRSSI() now returns twice the RSSI - original code dropped last bit
   - All methods are now public
   - 0dBm version: removed code that turns on 
 - +20dBm configures radio for maximum transmitter power (supported by original library). 0dBm configures for 0dBm transmitter power.
   - For other power levels, reference pages 21, 22 of datasheet https://github.com/sparkfun/RFM69HCW_Breakout/tree/master/Libraries/Arduino/RFM69 - not straightforward, and unsupported by original library. Requires direct modification of registers.
